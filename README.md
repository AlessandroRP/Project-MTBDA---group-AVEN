This was a group project for the course: Management Tools for Business Data Analyst, held by professor Simone Di Leo, at the University of Rome "La Sapienza". This repositary contains the codes of all the analyses that were conducted, specifically designed to run in the RStudio programming environment.

The datasets used in this analysis have been derived from data provided by the Italian Ministry of Justice, with some obtained more directly and others processed through more complex methodologies. All links to both our datasets and the original data sources are documented in our report.

This research examines the effectiveness of alternative detention measures—house arrest, probation, and community service—in reducing prison overcrowding and improving prison management in Italy. It also analyses regional performance, focusing on overcrowding levels, critical events, foreign detainee rates and policy effectiveness. Advanced statistical tools, including ARIMA and Clustering Analysis, are used to classify regions and predict future trends.
